# webDownload
A program that, when provided with links, will visit them in the web browser. <br>
Created with the purpose of bulk downloading links (download links that open the save/open dialogue) <br>
A very simple program with interchangable links (of course)<br>
I download learning resouces with this (from a list)<br>
<b>Made in python 3.7.2</b>
